    "show_help": "This table shows how many connections exist between each pair of attribute values. For example, if a link connects a node which is 'Male' and a node that is 'Female', this link contributes a count of 1 to both 'Male/Female', and 'Female/Male' cells of the table. A link connecting a 'Male' node to a 'Male' node will contribute 2 counts to the Male/Male cell.",
    "chord_diagram_help": "This panel will show either a <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_diagram'><b>chord diagram</b></a> (for category values) or a <b>scatterplot</b> (for continous values). They are useful to display the pairings for node attributes across links. Mouse over a particular color to display what attribute it corresponds to in <b>chord diagrams</b>. Mouse over a particular point to display what link corresponds to in <b>histograms</b>. <p/> To better understand a <b>chord diagram</b>, consider a network with 100 links. 40 of these links connect males to males, 10 of the links connect females to females, and 50 - males to females. Males will be allocated (40 x 2 + 50) / 200 = .65, of the total circumference (pie slice size). The connection between males and females (with the males as the focus) will be given 50 / (50+40) = 5/9 of the weight. The connection between females and males (with the females as the focus) will be given 50 / (50+10) = 5/6 of the weight."
